## 🧭 Repository Description

**Tarot Reflection App** is a Tarot-based application designed for **psychological reflection, creative exploration, and positive motivation**.
Tarot is treated as a **symbolic storytelling system**, not a tool for fortune-telling or superstition.

The app helps users slow down, reflect on their inner state, and gain gentle encouragement through meaningful symbols, thoughtful prompts, and small actionable suggestions.

## 🌱 Core Philosophy

* Tarot **does not predict the future**
* Tarot is a **language of symbols and reflection**
* Every interpretation is:

  * Psychologically grounded
  * Non-deterministic and non-absolute
  * Oriented toward clarity, autonomy, and emotional well-being

> ⚠️ This application is for entertainment and positive self-reflection only. It does not replace professional, medical, or psychological advice.
